This is a frontend developer task to make components that are clean.

run npm install to install the dependencies needed.

run npm start to start the application.

I came up with two different ways for solving the problem.

one in the App components using useState to hand state
and also used UseReducer to handle the smae task.
the code would have been better but I just did to the extent of my wxperience.
